Cash is king. Few dispute the value of an established currency, but the
limitations of physical currency are well-known. Innovators have digitized
currency to avoid these limitations — but the introduced alternatives have
their own restrictions, restrictions which diminish the currency's value.

One of the most important properties of physical currency is its distributed
nature. In the absence of a third party, anyone can transact at-will using
cash. The lack of a need for an arbiter or overseer implies freedom and liberty
in the currency: no one can stop another's transaction out of spite or
divergent moral principles.

This property is inherent to currency in its most natural form. So-called
"commodity currency" has an intrinsic value (e.g., a gold coin) that is valuable
outside of the scope of a sponsor nation. Indeed, many commodity currencies
came out of situations where there was no nation to otherwise endorse a
fiat currency, much like how gasoline was used to trade in post-World War II
Europe. It's only modern currencies that lack this property.

In the United States, transactions between individuals are often executed
by the ACH (Automatic Clearing House). The
[process is convoluted](https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/)
and not for the faint of heart — both individuals need a bank account with a
member institution, not to mention the Federal Reserve serves as a middle-man
for each transaction. It processes $43 trillion every year and is complicit
in the transaction censorship that plagues today's currencies.

If we accept that currency was originally and naturally free, then blocking
or restricting transactions between two individuals is an introduced
phenomenon. This is the result of a centralization of power: ability enables
action, and this centralization of power enabled transaction censorship in the
first place. Due to the ACH's centralized structure, the power over member
banking institutions lies with the federal government in ways that are
inconsistent with the original distributed model of currency.

To many — in this context, legislators — ability to do good implies a
responsibility to do good. This perception has turned the U.S. banking
system into one that no longer operates under the premise of a free currency.
The responsibility to do good has transcended any belief in the liberty that
defines money in its natural form.

Transaction censorship is no mythologized phenomenon. Under the
[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/subtitle-IV/chapter-53/subchapter-IV),
selected participants in the ACH are legally required to block transactions
related to illegal Internet gambling, a form of transaction censorship:

> ... requiring each designated payment system, and all participants therein,
to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted
transactions... (31 U.S. § 5364)

Where these "restricted transactions" are those that contribute to illegal
Internet gambling:

> ... a bet or wager by any means which involves the use, at least in part, of
the Internet where such bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal
or State law ... (31 U.S. § 5362)

Because transaction restrictions like this are commonplace, the government can
effectively control the flow of money throughout the banking system, either
under threat of punishment (the UIGEA can carry a prison sentence of five
years) or by seizing funds (as
[was done to 27,000 poker players, taking $34 million total](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124459561862800591)).
This transaction censorship devalues currency's distributed nature. It
enforces one's morality on another — not by criminalizing the crime — but
rather criminalizing the crime's symptoms. To prevent gambling, the wager
itself ought to be illegal as opposed to the surrounding events.

Today, online gambling is legal in many states and other countries across
the world. These statutes are often passed under the guise of preventing
money laundering, but the curtain falls when the crime's legality is disputed,
exposing the fiasco beneath.

One modern example of this is in the U.S. marijuana market. In the eyes of
the federal government, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance with
no accepted medical use. In a handful of states, marijuana is legal for
recreational use. Federalism implicates a complicated answer, but one thing is
clear: the banks don't want to touch pot money.

[The stories are plentiful](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/magazine/where-pot-entrepreneurs-go-when-the-banks-just-say-no.html).
Someone successfully runs a prosperous business specializing in cannabis — only
their finances are completely done in cash. Hundreds of thousands of dollars,
kept on-site in a safe, are surprisingly common for these massive operations.
They're effectively living in the Stone Age, using the American dollar as it
was first used hundreds of years ago. As a federally unlawful enterprise,
transactions related to marijuana sales constitute a form of money laundering.
Banks, often under the strict watch of the Federal Reserve and government
committees, face serious repercussions when found in violation of these
anti-money laundering laws.

Perhaps these regulations aren't in practice what they were intended to be.
Regardless, the nature of these laws makes this reality commonplace: one
cannot necessarily transact with their own money. Based on the business at
hand, banks and governments alike censor specific transactions according to
their specific moral compass — often attaching the money associated with a
crime to the crime itself. In this sense, the U.S. dollar isn't a free
currency, and the money in one's bank account isn't truly theirs.

When currency first appeared, it
took the form of a naturally distributed commodity money with intrinsic value.
Gold needs no state to approve its change of ownership, just as silver has no
moral compass. Currency as a medium of exchange is an
inherently free concept, one that is absent of external control. The U.S.
dollar has effectively disposed of this meaning in favor of another,
one based on imposing a subjective "good" on others.
By regulating domestic financial institutions and subsequently centralizing
immense power in the Federal Reserve and NACHA, our money is no longer free.
