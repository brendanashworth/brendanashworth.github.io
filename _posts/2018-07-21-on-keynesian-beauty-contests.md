The price of wheat, like all commodities, is determined by
supply and demand. Yet we see the seemingly unexpected in markets:
the consumption of wheat is constant throughout the year, as humans
never cease to eat. But supply is far from constant, as wheat is
only harvested in August and September (at least before modernity).

Based on this, we would expect wheat prices to be low during the
harvest season, and significantly higher during the off season.
With constant demand, supply exclusively determines the price.
Obviously, this is not what we see. Bread prices aren't seasonal;
monthly prices don't regularly deviate from the annual average price.
In other words, prices are never lowest during the harvest season.
This pattern goes all the way back to medieval Britain.

![Europe historical wheat prices](/images/2018-07-21/wheatprices.png)

The reason for this is simple: individuals would store grain
during the harvest season for sale in the growing season, evening
out the supply to give wheat a constant price. Indeed, the
data shows even pricing seven hundred years ago, a testament
to free markets.

These storers of grains were among the first speculators.
By purchasing grain from farmers during the harvest season,
when prices were low, they could profit by selling it
during the growing season, when prices were high. This process
eliminates the seasonal impact on prices.

By profiting from the resale of wheat, speculators
served the greater good in two ways. First, and most importantly, they
ensured that wheat would be available to all who
wanted it, regardless of time of year. Second, they helped ensure a
constant price, which reflects the true value of wheat throughout
the year. Speculators today continue to serve these two
roles for the public.

Despite their contributions, speculators are often attacked for their
seemingly unproductive, or even counterproductive, trades.
Modern economists are no exception to these attacks. John Maynard
Keynes offered such an attack in *The General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money*. Keynes argued that investors
no longer determine which stocks are of the best value — rather,
they seek to purchase stocks for the short-term,
in an attempt to outsmart other investors.

He puts this forward in [chapter 12, "The State of Long-Term Expectation,"
of *The General Theory*](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter12.html):

> Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions
in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a
hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice
most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a
whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself
finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of
the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same
point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of
one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average
opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree
where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects
the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the
fourth, fifth and higher degrees.

According to him, many traders no longer determine which capital goods
are the best investments on merit. Instead, speculators ignore the
investment on merit, instead to trade on the anticipated psychology
of the market. Keynes argues this speculation is harmful to markets.
I disagree.

# Trading Away Emotion

Keynes is the champion of human emotion in financial markets. He,
along with behavioral economists, believe that markets are more subject
to whim than reason. They explain the cyclical boom and bust cycle wholly
in this manner. It's Wall Street's overzealous investments that lead markets to implode,
just as it's the bankers' fear of lending that causes a slow economic recovery.
Only with rational government intervention can we escape these whimsical
marketeers in power, Keynesians argue.

Few think that markets are better when ripe with emotion. One investor's
happiness level shouldn't dictate the price of AAPL stock any more than
iPhone sales do. This would imply the price isn't accurate, going contrary
to the financial market's goal of appraising complex goods.

But yet Keynes criticizes the only individual to *rationalize* the stock
market: the psychological speculator. Just as a wheat speculator who knows
about the harvest season can trade away monthly price fluctuations,
a psychological speculator who knows about other investors' emotions can
trade away irrationality in financial markets.

It is logically contradictory to claim both that, first, speculators cause
market fluctuations that don't track real value and, second, speculators
trade to anticipate market psychology.

The psychological speculator removes emotion from markets, the complete
opposite of what Keynes alleges. If making markets entirely rational
is the goal Keynes seeks, he is wrong in criticizing the speculator,
who is the only actor actively pursuing such a goal.

# Finding a Balance

Keynes is right to separate investors into two groups: speculators
and the "enterprise":

> [I will] appropriate the term speculation for the
activity of forecasting the psychology of the market, and the term
enterprise for the activity of forecasting the prospective yield of
assets over their whole life ...

He is also right to identify a balance between the two. With too
many speculators, not enough attention is paid to the real yield of
capital goods; with too few, perhaps the market is too emotional
(although, based on his writings, I imagine he'd prefer a world
without speculators). His failure to find the right balance, however,
points to a fundamental misunderstanding of the economy as the
ultimate weighing mechanism.

Keynes offers a balance of "predominance," one which flips between
favoring the speculators and enterprise:

> ... It is by no means always the case that
speculation predominates over enterprise. As the organisation
of investment markets improves, the risk of the predominance of
speculation does, however, increase...

The market only turns too emotional when the speculators outnumber
the enterprise:

> Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of
enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes
the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.

I would hope Keynes at least has the foresight to recognize that
traders vote not in numbers but in capital. One speculator's trade
of $1 billion is worth equal to one hundred $10 million trades on
behalf of the enterprise. Keynes acts as though financial markets
are a democracy by the people, when instead they're a democracy by
the wallet.

Regardless, Keynes neglects to mention that financial markets
have their own regulator on the balance between speculators
and enterprise. The answer is obvious when pondering this question: how many
people *total* should trade markets, when adding speculators
and enterprise together?

We have no central planner dictating some 100,000 individuals to
trade markets for a living; each of them chose to do so by
free will. Instead, individuals should continue becoming traders
so long as profits are to be made; [once profits cease to be made
by new traders, there are enough working the
markets](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wall-street-employment-20150220-story.html).
This is the weighing mechanism of the market determining the optimal
number of traders on the Wall Street floor.

Equally, this weighing mechanism works to balance speculators
and enterprise. So long as there are profits to be made in
predicting the yield of capital investment, we need more enterprise
investors. And as long as there are profits to be made
predicting market psychology, we need more speculators.

Accordingly, if there are too many speculators, their trades will cease
to be profitable. We know traders are greedy — this only works to strengthen
the market response. Their unlimited greed will push them away from speculation,
hopefully into something more profitable and, thus, more productive.

In a democracy, one might wish that the opposing party
comprise fewer than 50% of the voting population, so as
to always maintain power. Comparing the financial market to
a democracy only leads to false conclusions: the speculators
aren't the opposing party, and a "predominance" isn't the
end of the world.

Keynes adds another reason for a lack of sufficient enterprise traders:

> Investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult
to-day as to be scarcely practicable. He who attempts it must surely
lead much more laborious days and run greater risks than he who tries
to guess better than the crowd how the crowd will behave; and, given
equal intelligence, he may make more disastrous mistakes.

If speculative trading was so
readily profitable, why don't we see vast swaths of workers
ditching their shovels for the trading desk? Why must Keynesian
stimulus spending be undertaken if I can so readily employ myself
predicting market psychology? With the knowledge of current
market conditions, this claim is easily refuted. There are
thousands of investors who exclusively trade long-term, [Warren
Buffett being the most famous](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/warren-buffetts-investing-style-reviewed/).
There's little to support his argument.

<!-- # Issues With the Analogy

The analogy also has some shortcomings that take away from its
ability to model the financial market.

First, it moves from the partial winnings model of financial
markets, where speculators each take a share of the profits
with successful trades, to a winner-takes-all model, where
only the speculators who choose most correctly win. Indeed,
the beauty contest always has a winning choice, and a number
of losing choices; in financial markets, all choices could be
winners or losers.

[NPR did
an experiment](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/01/14/132906135/ranking-cute-animals-a-stock-market-experiment)
where they emulated the Keynes beauty contest; participants
chose either the animal they thought was cutest or the
animal they thought *everyone else* would think was cutest.

> Marla Wood, a Planet Money listener from Colorado, was assigned
to the second group. She thought the loris was cutest. But she picked
the cat, because she thought that's what everybody else would pick.

> If the stock market were filled with Marlas, you could have a huge
kitten bubble, even if no one thought kittens were cute.

> It might look something like the housing bubble. People kept
buying houses -- not necessarily because they thought home prices
made sense, but because they thought everyone else would keep
buying houses at any price.

> As it happens, Marla guessed right, as did 75 percent of the people
in her group. But 25 percent of people got it wrong. They thought the
loris or baby polar bear would win. If this were a cute animal stock
market, that could throw off prices.

Second, it assumes that investments are
[price inelastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand).
This means
investors don't factor the price in when determining which
goods make the best investments. This is barely worth responding to,
as both empirically and anecdotally,
productive goods do not behave as if they're price inelastic.
A better beauty contest would include a self-correcting factor:
the more people that choose option A, the less attractive
option A becomes. In markets this is true; the more demand there
is for any particular capital good, its price will rise accordingly
until demand decreases enough to match supply.

# Stock, Wheat & Other Capital

It's important to note that the trading of all capital is similarly
beneficial to society. One might argue that speculators trading
wheat is more productive than one trading corporate stock or bonds.
This argument requires a distinction between two types of capital,
consumption goods and productive goods. The argument implies that
the price of one is more important than the price of the other;
one would have to argue that constant wheat prices are far more important
than accurate stock prices.

This is where the argument touches upon ideas of socialism and central
planning, ideas which leave little to be desired on behalf of its
proponent.

Wheat prices being constant only means that wheat prices are *accurate*.
The value and overall supply and demand are predictable, and
thus, the price should be constant. If the price
were constantly changing, we would say the price inaccurately reflects
the true value of the commodity. Equally, if a commodity's *value* inherently
changed regularly, we would say a constant price inaccurately reflects
its true changing value.

Thus, to argue that accurately pricing consumption goods is more important
than accurately pricing productive goods is to forget where the
consumption goods come from in the first place. Wheat is only cheap
because the means of production that created it were efficient;
wasteful factories and corporations only create expensive goods.
The only way to quantify efficiency across the market is with accurate
pricing. This is precisely how most socialist endeavours in practice end
up failing to do the most basic job of feeding the population. Without
accurately pricing the means of production (productive goods), there is
no way to determine which methods of farming wheat are the most productive,
or whether there are enough individuals employed in the agricultural field of
work.

Inexpensive consumption goods *require* accurately priced
productive goods. To argue only consumption goods deserve the
attention of speculators ignores the realities of the market
economy and the extensive pricing mechanism which coordinates all
actors within it.

# Speculation of the `n`th Degree

> We have reached the third degree
where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects
the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the
fourth, fifth and higher degrees.

Keynes may be right in believing there are speculators
who try to anticipate the experts, who in turn anticipate the experts,
on and on to some arbitrary `n`th degree. Instead, he is wrong in
arguing that, as the degree `n` increases, the speculators become
less and less useful to the public good.

In showing his fault, we must first determine the difference between
first degree speculation and second degree speculation. The first
might be the original wheat speculators, who purchase wheat at the
harvest annually for resale throughout the year.

The second degree speculator knows the first wishes to purchase wheat
annually during the harvest season. However the second knows [cyclical
wet and dry periods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27151502),
a few years long, influence wheat yields, making it cheaper during wet
periods and more expensive during dry periods. This speculator can
purchase more wheat during wet periods for resale during dry periods,
only to sell it back to the first speculator, who then sells it to
the end consumer.

In this example, each speculator removes a factor from wheat price.
The final consumer need not know whether it's currently wet or dry,
or whether it's currently the harvest or growing season, to purchase
wheat at its cheapest price.
In the second degree, two factors are removed, and this would continue
on to some arbitrary `n`th degree. As more speculators trade wheat,
its price becomes more accurate, and therefore more constant.

There is no difference between a speculator who sells directly to
the consumer and a speculator who sells to another speculator. The
market sees no difference between one who consumes wheat to eat and
one who does it for resale. Neither is inherently more productive
to society; their productivity is delineated only by the profits
turned by their trades. The speculator who makes the largest profit
gives the greatest public good; one with a small profit, a small
public good; the speculator who loses money does the public a disservice.
Fortunately, speculators quickly run out of money when their trades
are unprofitable.

# Daily Market Fluctuations

> Day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments, which
are obviously of an ephemeral and non-significant character, tend to
have an altogether excessive, and even an absurd, influence on the market.

Keynes is wrong when claiming day-to-day fluctuations in markets
are "ephemeral" or "non-significant." For a stock price change to be "ephemeral," it must
occur without a corresponding change in the investment's value. Otherwise,
the price is merely updating to the new true value, a rational
market response.

For Keynes to be correct, investments must rarely change value or
at least do so slowly. He's right in that, empirically, we see
the opposite in markets; stock and bond prices change regularly
and quickly, rarely going minutes between price updates.

However, traders know the true value of an investment changes
readily, as many factors are at play. The world economy is
so interconnected that every event often cascades in effect,
influencing the value of other investments greatly. This ranges from
[changing interest rates](https://www.finpipe.com/why-do-interest-rates-change/),
[earnings reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/29/do-iphone-x-sales-spell-trouble-for-apple/?utm_term=.764b433e4ccb),
political news like [adding tariffs on imports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-readies-new-tariffs-for-china-1529365844),
announcements from competitors, lawsuits, [journalists exposing
fraud](https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901),
changing market conditions, and even the weather.

By no means is this list comprehensive. Instead, it refutes the idea that investment evaluations
are simple. They include a number of contributing factors,
each of which changes daily. If the weather changes daily, then so
must stock prices:
[weather events readily impact tourism](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17hawaii.html),
which then impact each of the services that tourism effects.
To naively assume investments do not naturally fluctuate in value is to ignore
all of the factors which go into them.

> It is said, for example, that the shares of American companies which
manufacture ice tend to sell at a higher price in summer when their profits
are seasonally high than in winter when no one wants ice. The recurrence
of a bank-holiday may raise the market valuation of the British railway
system by several million pounds.

His citation of anecdotal evidence here is more ridiculous than anything.
If seasonal fluctuations like this were common knowledge — or just
one speculator knew — they would immediately cease to exist,
as they would be traded away. Just as wheat's seasonal fluctuations immediately
ceased once speculators began to purchase high and sell low,
ice manufacturers and railway companies would see stable evaluations despite
increased investor interest. It is the speculators here that disprove
his claims. Without speculators, such seasonal fluctuations would be
bound to exist. However, there exists little evidence that
seasonal fluctuations continue to exist today, or even did exist a century ago.
If they did exist,
speculators would trade on them immediately, long before an academic
like Keynes would ever hear about such an opportunity.

# Markets Are Rational

Keynes' allegations that markets are ripe with emotional influence are
additionally unfounded by empirical evidence in modern markets. One
of the most significant contributions to economics in the past
century was the work done on the [so-called "efficient markets
hypothesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis),
which alleges that the price of stocks consistently reflects their
true value, or at least all information publicly available about
its true value. Empirical evidence shows the returns on actively
managed investment funds are normally distributed, implying
routinely beating the market is rare if not impossible.
One conclusion made from the EMH is that emotion plays no noticeable
role whatsoever in pricing capital in financial markets.

Additionally, the simplistic predictions Keynes offers to
model the mind of a speculator have also been empirically
disproven. The ["random walk hypothesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street)
argues that markets
are completely unpredictable in their movements, and instead
have more in common with completely random price action than
human emotional behavior a speculator could predict.

# Taxing the Speculators

> These tendencies are a scarcely avoidable outcome of our having
successfully organised ‘liquid’ investment markets. It is usually
agreed that casinos should, in the public interest, be inaccessible
and expensive. And perhaps the same is true of stock exchanges...
The introduction of a substantial government transfer tax on all
transactions might prove the most serviceable reform available, with
a view to mitigating the predominance of speculation over enterprise
in the United States.

Of course, another tax is the perfect solution. Thankfully he says
"might prove" to lesson the fact that he's clearly thought little about
the effects of such a tax, as it would have no positive effect.

Even if speculation was harmful — the opposite of which has already been shown —
this tax does nothing to distinguish between speculation and enterprise.
This means each are equally discouraged, and instead, only the most
profitable of trades may continue. We have no idea whether
"enterprise" trades or speculative trades are more *profitable*;
that depends more on the specific trade than the reason of the trade.
This tax would only hurt the market, as opposed to preserve it,
and would only make prices less accurate by discouraging traders
from entering financial markets in the first place.

But Keynes' great solutions don't end at taxation. Unfortunately for
those among us who desire liberty, he advocates for central economic
planning of a mass scale:

> I expect to see the State, which is in a position to
calculate the marginal efficiency of capital-goods on long views
and on the basis of the general social advantage, taking an ever
greater responsibility for directly organising investment; since
it seems likely that the fluctuations in the market estimation of
the marginal efficiency of different types of capital, calculated
on the principles I have described above, will be too great to be
offset by any practicable [monetary policy].

Keynes's proposal here would mean a vast change in the government's
role in society and cannot stand unrefuted. Perhaps, by breaking
down his proposal into easier to understand language, it will be
clear how harmful this proposal would actually be.

First, he advocates for a financial market where government
traders exclusively price the means of production. This is what
"... calculat[ing] the marginal efficiency of capital-goods on long views
and on the basis of the general social advantage" means. Accordingly,
there would be little incentive for accurate prices: the profits
made on behalf of their trades would go to the state (if they went
to the traders, it'd be merely state-approved self-employment). Additionally, the government would
be the sole determiner of the "general social advantage." I suppose
only companies that the state deems "advantageous" would be priced
in such a market. Private individuals wouldn't pick and choose which
companies are best suited for their goals; the state is far better at
that then you could ever aspire to be, apparently.

He then suggests the state should pick and choose between possible
investments on behalf of its citizens. This is what taking "greater
responsibility for directly organising investment" means, and goes
contrary to the entire idea of the economic weighing mechanism we
established earlier. Indeed, to Keynes it would be only just if
the government dictated which restaurants and toy stores were created,
or which cars were created by which workers in which cities. The
ability to choose between careers would disappear, as the only
way to ensure an investment is realized is with the guarantee
of labor. Control over the means of production is all that communism
seeks, but yet Keynes suggests it right here.

Of course, his solution is for a problem that doesn't exist. The
fluctuations in the prices for capital goods reflect true value,
not the whimsical emotions of a Wall Street trader. It's only with
his fundamental misunderstanding of the role of a speculator that
he could offer such an absurd state-sponsored solution. Keynes
would never relinquish state control over a system he deems
problematic. Freedom, after all, is a luxury few socialists
can afford.
