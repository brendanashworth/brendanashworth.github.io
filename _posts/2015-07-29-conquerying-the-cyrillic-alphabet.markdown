Perhaps you're interested in learning a language that uses Cyrillic, like Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian - or perhaps you just want to pronounce Putin's name like a true Russian (Владимир Путин anyone?) - regardless, learning a new alphabet is much easier than it may seem at first. In fact, as an English speaker, you already know a lot of the letters!

To get you hooked onto learning Cyrillic, here are some letters you already know: **а**, **с**, **е**, **к**, **о**, **т**, and **м**. Each is pronounced very close to their English pronunciation, with the only difference of **е** making more of a *ye* sound, as in yet. Go ahead and read these words to practice:

- сок (sounds like *soke*)
- атом (hey, a cognate!)
- текст
- так (meaning *so...*)

That wasn't hard, was it? Here is one more to throw into the mix: **р**. Don't jump ahead though! This letter makes an *arr* sound rather than a *puh* sound. This is your first letter to learn - but don't overthink it. Whenever you see the letter while reading a word, just rewrite it to "r" mentally - your brain will catch on fast enough! Here are some more words:

- секрет
- камера
- карта (meaning map)

It isn't so hard, is it? Here is a curveball: **б** and **в**. You might recognize the latter, but **в** makes a *vvv* sound, like in vodka. The first, **б**, is used to make the *buh* sound, like in ball. Try it:

- краб (yum)
- тебе
- век
- собака
- рот (careful! it looks similar but sounds different!)

You've already learned 10 letters of Cyrillic! You're now 1/3 of the way. Here are some more: **н**, **п**, **ф**, **э** and **з**. The first looks familiar, again, but **н** makes an *enn* sound, like nibble and stone. **п** makes the *puh* sound you always wanted - this letter comes from the Greek letter **π**, or "pi". **ф** makes the *eff* sound, like fun, and **з** makes the *zzz* sound, like zebra and fuzz. **э** - not to be confused with **з** - almost sounds like the Canadian "eh". Here are some more fun words:

- верно
- кофе
- фон
- эта
- пот
- без

Here are four more: **ы**, **и**, **ь**, **ъ**. The **ы** (which looks like two letters, prepare yourself!) sounds like an *ihh* sound, like macaroni. The other two letters: **ь** and **ъ** are respectively called the soft sign and the hard sign. You don't need to bother learning these - they don't make sounds on their own. Just ignore them for now. The fourth, **и**, also makes an *ihh* sound - just like **ы**. Here are some more words:

- сыр
- знать
- ты
- спать
- вино
- рис
- писать
- макароны
- разраватывать

You're doing great! Let's tack on some more: **ю**, **ж**, **щ**, and **ш**. **ю** - which you might see as "ooh, an I and an O stuck together!" - sounds just like that, sort of a *yiu* sound. The **ж** sounds like a soft *jzuh* sound (like in version). **ш** makes the *shh* sound, and **щ** makes an *shhchh* sound. Here are some more words:

- бещь
- женщина
- кошка
- меню
- юбка
- вашим
- наша

You're almost done! Here are five more: **я**, **у**, **ё**, **х**, and **ц**. **я** makes a *ya* sound, **у** makes an *ooh* sound (similar to our "u"), **ё** makes a *yo* sound, **х** makes a *kh* sound (like in khaki), and **ц** makes a *ts* sound (like in tsar). Let's get some practice in!

- мужчина
- цвет
- пьёт
- урок
- царь
- потому
- её (*yeyo*)

Now for the last set: **д**, **г**, **ч**, **й**, **л**. **д** sounds like *d* in dog, **г** sounds like the *g* in blog, and **л** sounds like our *l*, like tool. The letter **й** makes a sound similar to the *y* in toy. The **ч** makes a *ch* sound, like in Chechen. Here is a final set of practice words:

- мной
- эта
- или
- если
- собою
- нашими
- своём
- серый
- хотеть
- молоко
- сакар
- когда
- книга
- газета
- перевод
- лошадь
- рубашка
- готовить
- проветить
- поддерживать
- вегетарианец
- Владимир Владимирович Путин (huzzah!)

Congratulations! If you could work your way through those last words, you can now pretty much read any Russian you want; this article taught you the Russian Cyrillic alphabet, since various languages use various types of the original alphabet. At this stage, you're probably working your way through the words as a kindergartner might - one sound at a time. But that's okay!

The only way to improve this is practice - my suggestion would be to try and attack a single article on the Russian Wikipedia - [this one](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87) is a start. Even if it takes you a week to read through the entire page, it will severely improve your reading skill. Practice makes perfect!
