In an attempt to better understand human genetics, the [genome-wide
association study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study)
was developed, or the GWAS. The GWAS is a large-scale
study which searches for particular gene variations associated with a
specific condition. For example, a GWAS might be done to identify four
possible alleles that contribute to increased risk for breast cancer.

The GWAS was expected to provide breakthroughs in genetic research by
identifying significant numbers of genes to explain hereditary
characteristics like height. Unfortunately, the results have been less
than satisfactory, as [Brendan Maher](https://www.nature.com/news/2008/081105/full/456018a.html)
explains:

> "GWAS, one of the most celebrated techniques of the past five years,
promised to deliver many of the genes involved... And to some
extent they have, identifying more than 400 genetic variants that
contribute to a variety of traits and common diseases. But even when
dozens of genes have been linked to a trait, both the individual and
cumulative effects are disappointingly small and nowhere near enough to
explain earlier estimates of heritability."

Maher claims that height is generally believed to be 80-90% heritable.
Despite this, the GWAS studies done on over 30,000 subjects were only
able to predict about 5% of that height based on the genes they found.

This gap between GWAS results and alleged heritability isn't only found
in height. Only [2.5% of asthma risk can be explained by known
genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750453/),
despite 25 studies done on over 150,000 individuals.
[GWAS results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831613/#S1title)
explain 6% of heritability for type 2 diabetes and just 1.5% for
fasting glucose levels. This is called the ["missing heritability"
problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064854/),
and has yet to be conclusively resolved. The GWAS has failed
to provide a genetic foundation for many important traits.

# The Omnigenetic Model

Some geneticists argue the GWAS has inherent limitations that prevent
scientists from predicting more of a characteristic's heritability on an
individual's genetic makeup. They propose a situation where a
characteristic is non-Mendelian to the tune of thousands of gene variants, each
contributing a miniscule amount. The GWAS would be
unable to distinguish such minute contributions from statistical
noise, they argue.

This argument is, unfortunately, not supported by the scientific method
— rather, it's an explanation of why the scientific method fails in
genetics. There is no currently available test for "very-low-penetrance
variants," and because these characteristics *must* (or so studies claim) be heritable, this is
often the accepted scientific consensus, despite the inability to test
the claim.

While later research might partially substantiate this so-called omnigenetic
model,
[which was proposed by a group of Stanford geneticists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5536862/),
as of today, the theory is untestable. It's wrong for
scientists, or even members of the public, to point to the omnigenetic
model as evidence of genetic traits beyond the scope of today's science.
One cannot claim athletic ability is 50% genetic and simultaneously
cite the omnigenetic model. That claim is nothing but conjecture,
ultimately doing little to help the actual science in genetics.

Significant non-genetic factors play into heritability, including
epigenetic factors and the environment. There ought to be more
questions as to the true genetic influence on any characteristic's
heritability, especially when multiple GWAS's refuse to turn up significant
evidence in favor of genetic contributions.

Over the past 200 years, the average male German's height
[has increased by 7.6%](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height).
If height were truly 80-90% heritable, a 7.6% regional change —
in the absence of genetic changes — is astonishing.
Perhaps humanity is, as a whole, approaching our genetic potential
for height. Or, perhaps, there are far more environmental factors
at play.

[Simeone et al. explain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4208652/)
the disparity well (inline citations have been excerpted):

> "Intriguingly, although, up to 90% of the variation in adult height
may be explained by genetic factors, stature-associated polymorphisms
have been found
to only explain between 2% and 3.7% of height variation. More
recent analyses have increased the combined predictive
power of the identified traits. Nevertheless, a large
fraction of heritable height‐associated factors has escaped detection by
conventional GWAS, consistent with
difficulties of previous association studies in finding variants robustly
associated with height."

Perhaps researchers simply need to keep looking for the golden egg
of genetics. Or, perhaps, it's just a wild goose chase.

# Statistics & The GWAS

The GWAS has also amassed a certain amount of criticism for other
shortcomings, as
[one article in the Journal of the American Medical Association
explains](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/181647).

> "... The massive number of statistical tests performed presents an
unprecedented potential for false-positive results, leading to new
stringency in acceptable levels of statistical significance and
requirements for replication of findings."

Indeed, in practice, many genetics studies fall fate to the same issues
Pearson, et al. point out. In some instances, the errors even cross the
line into so-called ["data dredging,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)
an abuse of statistics where a
relationship can be found to be statistically significant despite no
apparent causality.

In 2011, [editors from the *Behavior Genetics* journal issued a
warning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21928046) regarding
these studies:

> "The literature on candidate gene associations is full of reports that
have not stood up to rigorous replication ... It now seems likely
that many of the published findings of the last decade are wrong or
misleading and have not contributed to real advances in knowledge."

This isn't to say that the GWAS isn't entirely useless — on the
contrary, it has provided some great advancements towards a more
complete understanding of the human genome. But even these
great advancements come with serious shortcomings, further casting
doubt on the GWAS's ability to identify genetic influences.

[One GWAS performed on 16,175 women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3483246/)
found seven SNPs associated
with breast size (in the context of breast cancer research).
The researchers noted a prior twin study which established that
56% of breast size is hereditable.

The shortcoming here is the confounding and lack of control
for other variables attributing to breast size. A casual
interpretation of the 56% heredity implies significant
genetic expression for breast size. That conclusion is misleading
as it ignores the covariate of body size.

About one-third of that 56% breast size heredity is
"in common with genes influencing body mass index,"
[Wade et al. found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20874466).
Indeed, the GWAS had concluded that genes known for
an obesity risk factor — as a larger BMI is associated
with a larger breast size — contributed to breast
size. While that conclusion isn't false, it's certainly
misleading, especially in the context of the study.

GWAS results are often rife with confounding
variables like this, especially when a study's authors
don't bother to control for certain variables.

This isn't to say that the GWAS hasn't seriously
contributed to genetics research; on the contrary,
it has allowed for important discoveries linking
diseases with individual genes. But one must look
critically when presented with data from a GWAS.
Large sample sizes don't fix observational studies.
Studies ripe with confounding and p-hacking continue to
make their way into reputable journals.

Even then, when the GWAS fails to identify a genetic basis for
heritability, people routinely point to the omnigenetic model
as an explanation. If the trait has no readily available
explanation, it must be genetic, they say — even if the scientific
method has no room for such a conjecture.

We're all for science done right, but abuse of the GWAS
is an example of science done wrong. For editors of prestigious
medical journals to call their own published articles "wrong or
misleading," geneticists may have taken a serious misstep in the
use of such a powerful tool.
