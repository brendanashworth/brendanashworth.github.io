It's widely accepted that humans desire and act according to those desires.
Wants and needs are among the most essential parts of the human condition,
regularly studied by social scientists and philosophers alike. While the
existence of desire is seldom disputed, how we act on that desire is
surprisingly contentious for something so critical to the functioning
of our society. The resolution of this debate has serious implications;
a mistaken understanding of action resulting from desire leads to incorrect
models. Unfortunately, these incorrect models are increasingly used to
justify the immoral, all in the name of a greater good.

Among economists, this debate is framed in technical terms. Economists
define "utility" to be the satisfaction resulting from consumption — the
happier one is after purchase, the greater the utility. Cardinal utility
is the idea that utility is a number. Each person decides what to consume
by weighing the costs of the good against its utility. The seemingly harmless
concept of assigning a number to a traditionally qualitative idea, however,
is much more sinister than it appears.

It may be apparent that all human desire can be externally modeled in any
arbitrary way; for any set of desires, there exists both a cardinal and
a non-numeric model that explains the actions resulting from the desires.
Say, ranking A before B, as opposed to A = 6 > B = 3. It is, however,
problematic to disregard the difference between cardinal and non-numeric
utility. The presumption of cardinal utility has a number
of consequences, all of which are wrongly used to justify policy that
negatively impacts some for an arbitrary greater good.

Utilitarianism in the context of cardinal utility contends that every
individual acts on the basis of some arbitrary utility function. This
utility function determines the choices one makes by assigning some
number to certain actions — a real number in a mathematical sense.
Utility is generally established to be an abstract construct — economists
agree it is entirely immeasurable. Nonetheless, utilitarian economists
morally depend on the consequences of a numerical utility for their policy
prescriptions.

Numerical utility's existence, in a mathematical sense, has a number
of consequences for the analysis of social welfare. First, it implies
the utility of one person is directly comparable to that of another — an
actor must achieve more, less, or equal benefit when consuming some
good, as compared to another actor. Second, utility retains meaning in
the context of traditional mathematics operations. For example, if one
actor is better off after an action, while another is worse off, it is
meaningful to say the sum of their utility is greater than zero — in
other words, it is better for them as a whole for one of them to be
happier than the other sad. Finally, utility is separable from the
conditions of exchange. Two actors paying the same amount for some
good does not imply equal utility for that good; it merely implies they
both receive greater utility than the good's cost. Besides, the units for
utility are incomparable to the units of money.

Based on this presumption of numerical utility, utilitarian economists
now have justification for a number of morally dubious actions, categorized
under the umbrella of welfare economics. First, they define a social
welfare function, which is similar to the sum of its component utility
functions. Using this function, it's reasonable to hurt one individual
for the benefit of another, under the justification of a positive sum
delta. Indeed even violence is easy to justify by this logic: a moral
sacrifice in the pursuit of some greater good. The existence
of some social welfare function implies an ability to maximize its benefit
for all — it deceives one into the possibility of playing God with the
world's resources to reach a better outcome than might naturally occur.

Interestingly, cardinal utility's lack of being measurable does not discourage
economists from performing mathematics on it. Ethical hedonist Jeremy
Bentham [proposed a "felicific calculus"](https://www.utilitarianism.com/jeremy-bentham/index.html)
that would calculate the morality
of any given act — done by summing the pleasure and pain according to their
durations and intensities, across a number of individuals. Perhaps what's
most attractive about his utilitarian mathematics is that it morally
justifies the painless killing of others to free up their resources for personal use.

The ethical dilemma associated with these utilitarian conclusions warrants its
own discussion. Without a rejection of the idea that the ends justify the means,
it is logically consistent to assert cardinal utility as some basis for
violence. For a quantity that is both immeasurable and meaningless in its
true value, its properties certainly hold great weight in the justification
of action. Should utility be considered non-numeric, none of the above
conclusions would continue to be convincing. Indeed no activist in favor of
preventing violence would need to prove some component of utility; its
unknowable quality is perhaps its most attractive.

Interestingly, the debate as to whether utility is cardinal has no meaning
outside the scope of these consequences. Recognizing that non-numeric and
numeric models alike satisfy the need for some external model ought to imply
they are substitutable — these descriptions of utility simply describe some
state of an actor's desires, and nothing more. For someone who seeks to
justify no otherwise immoral action, this debate is thus entirely
unconsequential.

Empirically, however, this debate exists — and thus, there exists some who
seek to justify an otherwise immoral action on a utilitarian basis. A basis
built upon an imaginary foundation, a number conjectured from no measurement.
The theory of cardinal utility as it stands today, I argue, is nothing but
an attempt to justify the immoral. History is not on their side; perhaps
the millions of deaths in some unenumerable socialist uprisings serve to
show the vast lengths people will go to seek the greatest good for some
amount of people, maximizing their social welfare function. Some thousands
of pages of legislature require the moral bookends of cardinal utility,
opening only to show their immoral nature when released on each side.
