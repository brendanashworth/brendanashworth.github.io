On some college campuses, students live and breathe startups.
Out of the thousands of
universities in the United States, only a handful have a "startup culture" at a
meaningful level. These colleges churn out entrepreneurs at a rate unparalleled
elsewhere, often three or four times that of a research university.
The total revenue of their alumni's startups is comparable
to that of a developed country of millions.

Startup culture can be approximated by looking at the alma mater of
entrepreneurs who seek VC funding, according to a
[PitchBook report](http://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2016-2017_Edition.pdf).

The universities with the most prolific startup culture are Stanford,
MIT, and Harvard, according to the data. The rest of the Ivy League,
Carnegie Mellon, and Duke are below, with a significantly lesser rate
of entrepreneurs when adjusted for student enrollment.

Interestingly, while
UC Berkeley is often regarded as an entrepreneurship hub, this is only
true in terms of absolute startups created. While total startups created
is comparable
to Stanford, when the size of the school is considered (over 30,000
undergraduates compared to Stanford's 7,000), the entrepreneurs per capita
is meek at best, comparable to Northwestern or Tufts.

This metric isn't perfect. It doesn't take into account the
size of a school's engineering department or startups who aren't funded
by VCs. This, however, shouldn't discredit the metric as an approximation
of startup culture. Its utility far surpasses its shortcomings.

Startup culture is best considered as a binary phenomenon: a school either
has a startup culture or doesn't. Like a house of cards, one missing piece
leads to the culture's collapse.

Startups naturally cluster into startup hubs, a positive
feedback loop that increases the attractiveness of settling there. The
abundance of venture capital and technological progress improve the chances of
success for many companies — whereas a lack of nearby startups serve as an
innovation drought. This creates certain highly-valuable locations for
startups, like the Silicon Valley and Kendall Square. Inside is startup
culture; outside is nothing.

Paul Graham, a VC involved involved with YCombinator, maintains the incubator's
[requirement to move to the Silicon Valley](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html):

> "But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving, we
wouldn't. We wouldn't be doing founders a favor by letting them stay
in Nebraska. Places that aren't startup hubs are toxic to startups...
I don't know exactly what's suppressing all the startups [elsewhere]
—probably a hundred subtle little things—but something must be."

These hubs often contain groups whose goal is to encourage entrepreneurship
among their communities. Examples include a business school (Kendall
Square has the nearby MIT Sloan School of Management), proximity to capital
(Silicon Valley has Andressen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital),
technological advancement (any research university), and various startup
incubators.

All of the schools associated with a "startup culture" are considered
highly selective universities, ones where a very competitive admissions
process chooses the student body out of thousands of applicants. In 2017, MIT's
acceptance rate was 7.2%; Harvard's was 5.2%; Stanford's was 4.6%. It's
no coincidence that all schools with a startup culture have these admissions
practices — in many ways, the startup culture is a result of it.

This process refines the incoming class into a psuedo-super class.
The school ends up with a student body primarily comprised of forward-thinking
and highly motivated individuals. The luxury of picking and choosing between
applicants allows admissions officers to artificially select for qualities
they designate as most promising. It's even self-selecting, discouraging
applications from those with a low chance of admission.

The apparent result of these admissions practices is a student body of
refined talent — one with a high density of builders and makers, a
critical component of any startup culture.
[Sam Altman recommends](http://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds)
that those who seek to be entrepreneurs "build stuff and be around
smart people." The admissions process, although flawed in many ways,
makes this reality commonplace at such a school. Students
don't need to actively seek out projects and smart people; instead,
they're surrounded by them in all aspects of college life.

The rate at which startups are created is closely tied with
the university's acceptance rate, a statistic which reflects its
selectivity. While the graph above clearly shows the correlation,
most significant is how the selectivity alone does not account for
schools with a true startup culture, namely Stanford, MIT, and Harvard.
These schools are clear outliers in the data. A school's selectivity
approximates its startup rate in the absence of startup culture; when
the culture is present, students live and breathe startups, becoming
entrepreneurs at rates far higher than at other schools.

As a phenomenon, startup culture is contagious. Interactions between
students play a significant role in any one student's decision to create
a startup: the crowd collectively decides that forming startups is the
best way forward, and individual signals express this. The herd mentality
on such a campus develops in a way that favors entrepreneurship, practically
selecting it as the optimal way to climb the social ladder. Monkey see,
monkey do — the basics of the human unconscious don't change when one
enters a university. Simply put, if everyone is making startups around you,
then you're much likely to do so too. If nobody even mentions the word
"startup" then the option might not even occur to you. This explains the
binary quality of startup culture: startups encourage other startups,
while a lack thereof inhibits others.

Few successful startups today are formed by one individual; instead, they're
often created by two or more co-founders. Finding the right co-founder is
perhaps one of the most pivotal moments for a company's future. Fortunately,
most colleges are ripe for co-founder picking. The abundance of makers and
smart people on these campuses leads to a relative ease in meeting someone
else with the right mentality.
[Paul Graham's metaphor](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html) expresses this
well:

> "At a good college you're concentrated together with a lot of other
ambitious and technically minded people—probably more concentrated
than you'll ever be again. If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there's
a good chance it will hit another nucleus."

Sometimes, these people come to college knowing they're looking for a
co-founder. They might even choose their college on that basis, optimizing
for future choices. Ambitious entrepreneurs look for schools with a startup
culture to attend. They might face a choice between already creating a
startup or going to college. Without an idea already in mind,
college can often be a relatively safe way to move forward. Thus those
with the ambition know what they're looking for and seek it out.
It's just like what's done in the
[Silicon Valley](http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html);
like gathers like.

> "What nerds like is other nerds. Smart people will go wherever other
smart people are. And in particular, to great universities. In theory
there could be other ways to attract them, but so far universities
seem to be indispensable. Within the US, there are no technology hubs
without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer
science departments."

Startup culture is rare in that it cannot be broken down into one or two
key characteristics. The stars need to align for startup culture to develop.
The location has to be right: a city teeming with other small businesses,
an abundance of venture capital, a research university or two. It needs to
be filled to the brim with people who question everything, accept
nothing, and are interested in becoming a co-founder. Everything needs to
come together for startup culture to arise. This phenomenon explains
the lack of startup culture elsewhere. Startup culture is all-or-nothing,
and few colleges have it all.
