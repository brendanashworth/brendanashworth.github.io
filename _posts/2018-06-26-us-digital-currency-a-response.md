A few months ago, Sam Altman
[published a blog article](http://blog.samaltman.com/us-digital-currency)
proposing that the U.S. government create its own cryptocurrency, "USDC."
He suggested a number of features the currency could have and argued
that such a cryptocurrency might become the *de facto* currency of the future.

While Sam Altman deserves a lot of respect for his success as an entrepreneur,
this latest article was ripe with economic fallacies and an unfailing
(and equally undeserving) tribute to the state.

Altman begins his proposal by claiming that current cryptocurrencies have inherent
issues (at least in the eyes of the state). Two of the three issues are just red
herrings, while the third isn't a real issue in the face of anyone but the state.

> And from the perspective of a nation, there are real problems with current
systems, especially around pseudo-anonymity, ability to function as an actual
currency, and taxability.

If psuedo-anonymity is a problem, then true anonymity would be an even bigger
problem. Unfortunately for his argument,
[anonymity has been the status quo](https://blog.ashworth.in/2018/03/06/liberty-freedom-and-the-us-dollar.html)
for centuries, only changing marginally with the adoption of modern banking.
Cash is entirely anonymous and practically untraceable; it requires no authority
to monitor or approve transactions.

Besides, USDC wouldn't have a monopoly over transactions. Currencies
first originated as commodities with inherent value (e.g., gold or copper)
and could always return.
Outside of criminalizing barter, the state cannot combat anonymous transactions;
the introduction of USDC would be neutral on this front.

I'm not sure what the "ability to function as an actual currency" actually entails.
I'd assume Altman describes an oft-given critique of bitcoin, which is that
its purchasing power fluctuates wildly. Perhaps he
thinks a lack of adoption is its inability to be a currency. Either way,
he neither addresses the current issue, nor does he propose how USDC would
solve either of the two criticisms commonly given above. It's a generally meaningless
"real problem."

Finally, he describes an inability to effectively tax cryptocurrencies as
the final problem. Surely, this is a problem in the eyes of the government,
which has found few areas outside the scope of its tax collectors' outstretched hands. The
government's readiness to ascertain the wealth contained within its borders is
unparalleled. Apparently, the opportunity to tax even more must be seized.
National cryptocurrencies are the windfall the IRS has been waiting for.

> Ideally the initial coins would be evenly distributed to US citizens and
taxpayers—something like everyone with a social security number gets two
coins, one that is immediately sellable and one that you have to keep for 10
years.

This "ideal" situation is problematic in every sense. It's clearly
an attempt at an egalitarian distribution of wealth, but it's simply farcical.

Coins cannot just be given away. They are no more valuable than
chocolate coins or post-it notes with "$20" written on them. There's no
guarantee that anyone will accept them as payment for resources. Without
an additional increase in capital wealth, an increase in the money supply
is meaningless. If giving each person two coins increased their wealth by
a non-zero amount, then why wouldn't we give them 200 coins? It's obvious
that the value of these coins would be zero. Scarcity alone does not
imply value.

The coins would have to be introduced with some sort
of fixed exchange rate. This was how almost all modern currencies
were introduced: with the gold standard. It's the only way to guarantee
value for a new currency without pure speculation driving its price,
as bitcoin's huge evaluation swings now prove.

There's also no reason to obligate the saving
of USDC. I can't tell whether it's a grand retirement savings ruse
or, more likely, preventing someone from selling away all of their
worthless tokens.

> USDC could require that certain transaction can only happen with wallets
with known owners. It could even build a tax system into the protocol.

I cannot fathom how blocking transactions between individuals would
attract users. Besides, Democrats often critique voter I.D. laws for discriminating
against minorities and the poor. A widespread inability to use one's government-given
currency would deal significantly more pain to those same communities.

The taxes again make their return to the spotlight. It's almost as if there's no other
reason to fabricate such a currency.

> A tricky part of this would be how to balance letting the network
have control over itself and letting the government have some special
degree of input on ‘monetary policy’. It’s certainly ok for the
government to have some, but I think the network needs to be mostly
in charge (e.g., the government couldn’t be allowed to arbitrarily
inflate the currency when it wanted to).

If "ok" is the standard in determining government power, I'm glad
monetary policy falls into the "certainly ok" category. Sarcasm aside,
absolutely none of this currency is network-controlled. No distributed
system could ever be created to satisfy all of a statist's demands.
"Input," as he describes it, is just a facade for *control*.
Besides, the government would never willingly surrender such power.

Interestingly, Sam Altman seems to think that inflating the currency should
be off the table for the government. This is an unexpected twist of plans
for a currency whose sole purpose is to increase the power of the state. He
might not know that monetary policy often includes arbitrary inflation, like
quantitative easing.

> The government can likely create a lot of de novo wealth for its citizens
in the process.

Finally, we've arrived at the core misunderstanding behind Altman's proposal.
Wealth isn't created by the government in the form of minting digital coinage.
That process is no more effectual that printing Monopoly money and giving it
away to the poor.

Indeed, if this approach was able to *create wealth* for people, this exact
proposal would have already been realized. Nothing stops someone from copying
these exact steps and emulating such a currency, even keeping all of the tokens
for themselves.

Altman unknowingly falls into the same pit Keynes fell into nearly a century ago.
Wealth is created through private innovation, not at the hands of some all-powerful
bureaucrat. After all, if it were possible for Congress to create wealth, we'd all
be rich. If running the Federal Reserve's printer were all we needed
to live in luxury, it'd be running non-stop.

Owning currency entitles you to purchase resources elsewhere for fair value.
$5 is equivalent to some amount of capital goods, like a
gallon of gasoline. But while one can print money, one cannot
print gasoline. Gasoline requires significant investment (e.g., labor)
to harvest from natural sources.
It's illogical to believe that arbitrarily growing the money supply
leads to more capital goods, as capital goods require the consumption of
*other* goods to produce. Money supply is infinite; capital goods are finite.
Printing a $5 banknote doesn't generate more gasoline elsewhere in
the world; it merely depletes a currency of its purchasing power,
inflating the U.S. dollar everywhere its spent.

This is true for all commodities, not just currency. If crude oil
production skyrocketed
throughout the world, the price of gasoline would plummet. Supply
and demand dictates this natural response, and money is not exempt
from the free market.

[In Keynes's *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter10.html),
a similarly misguided understanding of wealth creation is proposed.

According to him, the capital wealth of a community can be increased
by burying freshly printed banknotes in abandoned coal mines.

I suppose the only reason this process isn't done continuously is
a dearth of available coal mines; indeed, it seems foolproof.

> If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury
them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then
filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private
enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the
notes up again .., there need be no more
unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income
of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become
a good deal greater than it actually is.
